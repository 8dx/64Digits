To Install 64Digits:
	1) Install Yii Framework somewhere outside of the repo. 
		(Recommended to be in ../yii, assuming you're in a public_html folder)
			Should look like this:
			/yii/{framework}
			/public_html/{v4}
	2) Modify index.php to point to that Yii install
		The current copy is in a sub-directory, so it's pointing two directories back.
		Most likely, you'll need to remove one set of ../ from the path.
	3) cp protected/config/main-copy.php protected/config/main.php; 
		Configure the main.php file with your own database credentials (component -> db)
	4) Import the fresh.sql file
